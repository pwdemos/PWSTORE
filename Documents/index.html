				<p><strong>We have some options calculate as:</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li>Base on a number of resources: Text, Clipart, Images, Uploaded Image…</li>
				<li>Base on number of colors: 1 Color, 2 Color or full color</li>
				<li>Base on size of print production: A1, A2,…A6</li>
				<li>Fixed price for each quantity</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Of course, all options base on the quantity range which user want to orders.</p>
				<p>For example, Their design has 2 colors and they order 7 products. And base price of product is $10</p>
				<p>We have calculated price table as:</p>
				<p><strong>quantity / 2 colors</strong></p>
				<p>———–</p>
				<p>5/0.5</p>
				<p>———–</p>
				<p>10/0.7</p>
				<p>So price for product is: <strong>(price base + option price )*quantity + printing price</strong> = $10*7 + 0.7 = $70.7</p>
				<p>option price :<i> equal 0 in this case.</i></p>
				<p>printing price : <i>0.7 because quanity in range of 5 and 10, So it take price of 10.</i></p>
